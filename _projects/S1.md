## Garden of Remembrance

*Design Studio (2013 Fall), City University of Hong Kong*

This studio required to transform the emotion from the images to the architectural spaces to form a garden of remembrance. Images implied the sequence of visiting the garden and the tran-sition of the space. The garden of remembrance provides the place for people to tribute their love and expresses their feeling. A spatial arrangement can make people to change their mind and have a new journey.
