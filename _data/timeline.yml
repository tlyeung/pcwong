               architectural design, but also involved in urban planning, 
               heritage preservation and building construction. It helped 
               me to understand different aspects and evaluate my own desired 
               interest. In the final thesis, I focused on the master planning 
               about ecological living style corresponding with related architectures.

  description: As a guest student, I worked for one studio only. The studio
               mainly considered the urban landscape between density, urban 
               typologies and liveability. The beginning part was required to 
               analyse the site context with history, function, existing use, 
               then to discover the problem for function and motion. It helped 
               to propose several scenarios to deal with those problems and create 
               a better environment for the citizens.
